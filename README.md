# Hangman_Game

This game was developed on Vue.js and it's purpose is to stimulate reasoning skills and creativity.
The rules are the same as when we play on paper.
We enter a secret word, a tip and after that the game opens a screen with a keyboard, dashes equivalent to the number of letters in our word.
The keyboard was programmed to disable the chosen letter and the image of the gibbet changes after each mistake.
